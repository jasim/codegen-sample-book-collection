# Codegen

This directory was generated by [Protoship Codegen](https://protoship.io/). It contains the generated HTML & CSS for your Sketch designs.

The generated code is meant to be modified by programmers to build large real-world web applications. We use the Tailwind CSS library to maintain code quality. Tailwind makes the design-scales (spacings, colors, typography etc.) an explicit part of the code. This ensures that the site maintains visual consistency and helps keep the code clean.

## Exploring the code

Take a look at [tailwind.css](tailwind.css) to see the entry-point to the CSS code. You can add any custom CSS you want here.

The scales generated for your designs are in [tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js). Most changes you might need in the CSS can be made by modifying this file.

Learn more about Tailwind from [the official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind).

## Development

    npm install
    npm run build

Run `npm run build` every time the CSS configuration is changed so that the final `bundle.css` can be updated.

To learn how you can integrate Tailwind to your project's build pipeline, see [Using Tailwind in your CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#3-use-tailwind-in-your-css).

## A note on code quality

Codegen tries to generate clean HTML & CSS that you can fully understand, change, and own as your own code. But this depends largely on the input Sketch file that was used to generate the code. A precisely designed Sketch file that uses a consistent color palette and spacing guide will produce an equally good CSS codebase. To learn how you can achieve this, please read [Refactoring Sketch designs to improve generated code quality with Protoship Codegen](https://protoship.io/codegen/refactoring-sketch-designs.html).

If you have any thoughts on how we can make this easier and improve the quality further we'd love to hear from you. Do write to us at [hello@protoship.io](mailto:hello@protoship.io).
